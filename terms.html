      <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements</li>

    <h2>4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h2>

    <h3>4.2 Account Security</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use of your account. inkLedger is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account credentials.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Account Termination</h3>
    <p>You may close your account at any time by contacting us at jace@inkledger.app. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or for any other reasonable reason.</p>

    <h2>5. PLATFORM ROLE AND LIMITATIONS</h2>
    <p>inkLedger acts exclusively as an intermediary platform that facilitates bookings and payments between Artists and Clients. We are not a party to any agreement between Artists and Clients.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not employ, endorse, or recommend any Artist</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of tattoo services</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for the actions or omissions of Artists or Clients</li>
      <li>Any disputes between Artists and Clients must be resolved directly between the parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>inkLedger shall not be liable for any claims arising from or related to the contractual agreement between an Artist and a Client.</p>

    <h2>6. DEPOSITS AND PAYMENTS</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Deposit Requirements</h3>
    <p>When booking an appointment, Clients are required to pay a deposit to secure the appointment. The deposit amount is set by the Artist within the platform's allowed range (EUR 50 to EUR 500, in increments of EUR 10).</p>

    <h3>6.2 Non-Refundable Deposits</h3>
    <p>All deposits are <strong>NON-REFUNDABLE</strong>. By paying a deposit, Clients acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The deposit will not be refunded under any circumstances, including cancellation or no-show</li>
      <li>The deposit secures the Artist's time and preparation</li>
      <li>The deposit will be deducted from the total cost of the tattoo upon completion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.3 Platform Fee</h3>
    <p>A platform fee of 8% is added on top of all deposits. This fee covers payment processing (Stripe), SMS notifications, and platform operational costs. The platform fee is paid by the Client and is non-refundable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: EUR 100 deposit + EUR 8 platform fee (8%) = EUR 108 total charged to Client</li>
      <li>Artist receives the full deposit amount</li>
      <li>Platform fee is lower than competitor rates (8% vs 10%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.4 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>Payments are processed securely through Stripe. Deposits are transferred directly to the Artist's connected Stripe account. inkLedger does not hold or manage Artist funds.</p>

    <h3>6.5 Refunds</h3>
    <p>inkLedger has a strict no-refund policy on deposits. Artists may, at their sole discretion, choose to refund a deposit through their own Stripe dashboard. inkLedger is not responsible for facilitating refunds.</p>

    </ul>

      <li>The deposit is forfeited and non-refundable</li>
      <li>The Artist may seek additional compensation for damages incurred</li>
      <li>Repeated no-shows may result in the Client being banned from future bookings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.4 Tattoo Consent</h3>

      <li>They are at least 18 years of age</li>
